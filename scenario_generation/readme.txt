- To run generate_provinces_json.py, geopandas must be included in the python environment
- generate_provinces_json.py reads the results of the data processing stage from the model_data folder and generates a scenario.json
- the gpkg should be generated from the data_processing/shapefile folder and placed in model_data
- the contents of the input folder can be used to change the inital infected cell state (infectedCell.json), and the default simulation configuration parameters (default.json)
